## Overview
Create an interaction on screen with 5 state changes in a group of two. Made for Texas A&M's Human Computer Interaction Course Spring 24 (CSCE 436-500/200).

## Requirements
- Include 5+ state changes in sequence
  - Click a button and a feedback (e.g., loading an image) is one change
  - Swipe right and show the menu is one change
  - Not the 5 buttons that simply changes the display
- (possibly) Utilize your assignment!
  - You can mock a complex user interaction 
  - file upload - load a new canvas with file browser design
  - camera input – place a gray placeholder for taking photo, load a prestored picture once taking picture action is done
  - access to the photo library – create a canvas with gird images
